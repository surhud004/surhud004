Hello, my name is Surhud (/sur-hood/) (he/him). I am a passionate software developer who has an expertise and a keen interest in Node.js, frameworks like NestJS and REST APIs. For the most part, I love to work on the back-end logic and the infrastructure of a project. In my free time, I like to build some cool side projects just 
for fun, like this one here -> the [Foodish](https://github.com/surhud004/Foodish) API!

The quickest way to reach me is via ðŸ“§ [email](mailto:surhud.bhagali@gmail.com?subject=Hello%20from%20GitHub).

Fun fact:
The [Foodish](https://github.com/surhud004/Foodish) API has been listed under the largest free APIs collection: [public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#food--drink) and was accepted as a part of the GitHub #hacktoberfest-2020!
