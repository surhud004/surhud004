Hello, my name is Surhud (/sur-hood/) (he/him). As an enthusiastic and creative developer, I build simple, colourful and responsive web applications as well as some amazingly cool Android apps. You probably know me because of the [Foodish](https://github.com/surhud004/Foodish) API, but I have some other cool projects here as well, check them out!

You can reach me fastest via [email](mailto:surhud004@gmail.com?subject=Hello%20from%20GitHub).
